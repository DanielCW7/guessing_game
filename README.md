# Guessing game

### :round_pushpin: Purpose
This is a simple guessing game where you have a certain number of attempts to guess the correct number.

### Getting started
#### 1. After cloning this repo and opening it up in your own text editor, install Rust:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
<br/>
<br/>
After installing, you may need to re-start your shell

#### 2. Check the install
`rustc --version`</br>
`cargo --version`

#### 3. Create a cargo build
`cargo build`

#### 4. Run the program
`cargo run`
<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well, you should see a prompt asking to guess a number. Since there is no limit on the number of guesses, the program ends after you guess correctly.
